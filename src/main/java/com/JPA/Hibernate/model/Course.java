/*
âœ…cascade = ...
-1- Apply only on the owning side, because: Only owning side controls the DB operation.
-2- Cascade effects (PERSIST, REMOVE, etc.) are triggered from the owning side.

ðŸ”¥ Why not on inverse side?
-1- Inverse side can't update the relationship.
-2- Setting cascade there has no real effect (won't propagate).

âœ…fetch = ...
-1- You can define fetch on either side, but itâ€™s more useful on:
-2- The owning side (default fetch rules apply better).
-3- The side you're accessing the most in code.

/*
âœ… General Best Practices

Relationship	Recommended FetchType	Why
@ManyToOne	    EAGER (default)	        Usually small & needed immediately
@OneToOne	    EAGER (default)	        One-to-one â†’ usually tightly bound
@OneToMany	    LAZY	                Might load huge collections
@ManyToMany 	LAZY	                Usually large and not always needed
